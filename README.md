🚀 SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Success Prediction

IBM Data Science Professional Certificate — Capstone Project

📌 Overview

This project answers a key operational question for SpaceX:
“Can we predict whether a Falcon 9 booster will successfully land?”

Booster recovery is essential for reducing launch costs by tens of millions of dollars, and accurate predictions support mission planning, budgeting, and engineering decisions.

This end-to-end project demonstrates real data science workflow:
data collection → cleaning → EDA → feature engineering → modeling → insights → business recommendations.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze historical Falcon 9 launches to understand drivers of landing success

Build machine learning models to predict landing outcomes

Identify high-impact features for operational and financial decision-making

Demonstrate proficiency in Python, SQL, visualization, and ML workflows

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

REST API + Web Scraping for SpaceX launch data

SQL

Plotly & Folium for interactive and geospatial analysis

📊 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection

Pulled mission data from the SpaceX API

Scraped additional tables from Wikipedia

Cleaned, merged, and validated multiple datasets

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identified correlations between payload, booster version, launch site, and landing success

Visualized trends using scatter plots, heatmaps, boxplots, and mission timelines

Mapped landing outcomes using geospatial plots

3️⃣ Feature Engineering

One-hot encoding for categorical fields

Scaling of payload and numeric features

Final modeling-ready dataset creation

4️⃣ Machine Learning Models

Evaluated four supervised models:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

🏆 Best Model

Decision Tree Classifier
Delivered the most stable performance and best interpretability for engineering teams.

🔍 Key Insights
🚀 1. Booster Version is the strongest predictor

Upgraded boosters (Block 5) significantly improve landing likelihood.

📦 2. Payload mass affects landing outcomes

Heavier payloads reduce recovery probability due to energy and fuel constraints.

📍 3. Launch sites show clear patterns

Some sites have notably higher success rates due to weather, geography, and mission type.

🌤️ 4. Additional metadata could improve accuracy

Variables like wind speed, cloud cover, and booster condition would further strengthen predictions.

💼 Business Recommendations

These are framed for real operational value:

Use upgraded booster variants for missions where booster recovery is strategically important.

Assign heavy-payload missions to launch sites with higher historical success rates.

Collect more mission-level environmental data to refine future predictive models.

Integrate predictive analytics into pre-launch planning to estimate reusable cost savings.

These recommendations show the model’s direct financial and engineering value, something recruiters look for.

⭐ Why This Project Stands Out

Recruiters will immediately recognize that you can:

Work with real APIs and messy data

Build interpretable and accurate machine learning models

Extract business-relevant insights

Present findings in a structured, professional way

Think like both a data scientist and a consultant

This is the kind of project that gets shortlisted because it shows complete, real-world capability.
